  <h4>Things I've Learned</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><h5>Beginninng to understand the "float" property in CSS. The float property was used to float the links on the top and the bottom of the page.</h5></li>
    <li><h5>I understand the importance of moving divs correctly.</h5></li>
    <li><h5>I understand the importance of using divs in a stylistic perspective.</h5></li>
    <li><h5>Using the Chrome Developer Tools to debug and troubleshoot problem areas</h5></li>
    <li><h5>Transferring what I see from sites to code is the best way to properly learn HTML and CSS. I've learned bits and pieces of HTML and CSS in modules, but taking the time to actually apply those rules is the best way to learn and to also stick with it. I had a ton of fun creating this project. I have many more to go :)</h5></li>
